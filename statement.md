 Project Statement – Personal Finance Manager

- Statement
The *Personal Finance Manager* project is created to help individuals track their income and expenses in a simple and organized way. Many people struggle to manage their daily financial activities, leading to confusion about how much they earn, how much they spend, and how much they save. This project provides a basic Python program that allows users to record income, expenses, and automatically calculate the remaining balance.

The main purpose of this project is to make financial tracking easier for beginners, students, and anyone who wants a simple tool without complicated features. By entering basic inputs such as income amount, expense amount, and descriptions, the user can maintain a clear record of their financial transactions.

This program works through simple calculations and displays a summary that helps users understand their spending habits and financial condition. It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-life problems.

The Personal Finance Manager can be expanded in the future with additional features like saving data to files, generating monthly reports, adding graphs, and even building a web or mobile app for better usability.
